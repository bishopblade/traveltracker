Travel Tracker
=============

Travel Tracker is a simple application designed to ease group travel by removing the need for the continuous circle of calls back and forth verifying
whether the travellng parties have arrived or not. It is questionably useful, but the main purpose it serves is to teach me
Android/Java. I hope to accomplish a high-quality, well-written codebase with this project, as well as prepare me for more advanced products as a young developer.
